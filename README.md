# Manage My Comics

Manage My Comics was started as a final capstone project for school, and since then I have added to, updated, and refactored the project.

Manage My Comics is a virtual comic book collection assistant. This application allows you to create a user account (STANDARD or PREMIUM) which can create collections and add comics to those collections.

M.M.C. was created using a PostgreSQL database, Java back-end DAOs and controllers, which talks to a Vue.js front-end using RESTful web services. This is a single page application.

This application uses the Marvel Developer API for providing the comic information.
